<br>
<li>The purpose of this experiment is to determine if the use of a language with universal easy-to-learn and easy-to-translate syntax and semantics, void of complex linguistic participles and single-threaded system of communcation, would be viable, primarily for use in the realm
of internet intercommunication, in pursuit of a more transparent, accessable, and understandable system of socialization for every region of the earth, without the need of an intermediary, such as an interpreter, or complex translation algorithms.
</li>

<br>
<li>If you can see yourself as part of this bigger cause, an effort by a small organizaion with a unifying vision, with a small but slowly growing number of participants, who see a future where internet interaction can be free from all communication barriers, with a new dimension
of transparency to use as a weapon against mis-information and propaganda, continue reading to see how you can help point humanity towards this unifying goal.
</li>
<br>
<li>The structure of Cronus system of communication is extremely simple to understand, but is designed in a way to convey as much meaning and understanding in as little space as possible.</li>
<br>
<li>Your message will be structured as such:</li>
<ol>
<li>
"entity of attention (adjective, noun, verb, etc)" : "adjective or information to attribute to the entity"</li>
