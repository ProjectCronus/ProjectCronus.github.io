<h2 style="font-family:courier;"> What is this? </h2></font>
<ul><font color=#00C1FF style="font-family:courier;"> This is an experiment designed by an undisclosed organization from an undisclosed institution, positioned in a politically neutral location on earth.
The identity of our organization will be disclosed once the experiment is complete.

<br>


<li>The purpose of this experiment is to determine if the use of a language with universal easy-to-learn and easy-to-translate syntax and semantics, void of complex linguistic participles and single-threaded system of communcation, would be viable, primarily for use in the realm
of internet intercommunication, in pursuit of a more transparent, accessable, and understandable system of socialization for every region of the earth, without the need of an intermediary, such as an interpreter, or complex translation algorithms.
</li>

<br>
<li>If you can see yourself as part of this bigger cause, an effort by a small organizaion with a unifying vision, with a small but slowly growing number of participants, who see a future where internet interaction can be free from all communication barriers, with a new dimension
of transparency to use as a weapon against mis-information and propaganda, continue reading to see how you can help point humanity towards this unifying goal.
</li>
<br>
<li>The structure of Cronus system of communication is extremely simple to understand, but is designed in a way to convey as much meaning and understanding in as little space as possible.</li>
